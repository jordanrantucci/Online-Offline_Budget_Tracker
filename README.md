# Online-Offline_Budget_Tracker

## Description 

This is a CWRU coding bootcamp homework assignment practicing Node.js, express, the non-sequelized database of MongoDB and Mongoose.  The project tests the students ability to incorporate the NPM mongoose database with a MVC file structure.  The project uses webpack, manifest and service workers to allow for offline data storage.  The app allows a user to update the budget while offline so that when they connect the information is still stored.  This project utilizes the MVC (Model-View-Controller) file set up.  The project also incorporates the ability to deploy an app onto heroku and use MongoDB Atlas database and Amazon Web Service to host the data.

AS A USER I would like a simple application that I can use to track a budget while bothe on and offline.
